        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Last week I failed to win a medal in the National Indoor Track&Field Championships for Masters (that is: elderly athletes).
            It was the second time in a row that I missed out on the medals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since I started track running, almost 10 years ago, I had always won a medal at the Indoors Championships.
            But last summer I missed out on the medals during the Outdoor Championships for the first time since 2012.
            Are my running days over now?
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyhow, I feel that this might be a good moment to start describing my Track and Field hobby.
